# Recipes cannot use Debian 10 source code

## apt-native
Poky is using apt version 1.2.24.
Debian 10 apt (1.8.2) does not provide option  `--force-yes` which is required by
_meta/lib/oe/package_manager.py_.

## prelink-native
Poky has its own [prelink-cross](http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/prelink-cross) package.
Debian 10 prelink (0.0.20131005-1+b10) does not support changing root directory
which is required by _meta/classes/image-prelink.bbclass_.


# PACKAGECONFIG variation support

For now, to keep meta-debian minimal and reduce effort of maintenance,
meta-debian only provides recipes to support PACKAGECONFIG features which are enabled by default.
More recipes may be added in future if there are any requests.
